What Though Life Conspire To Cheat You 
By Aleksander Sergeevitch Pushkin
What thought life conspire to cheat you
Do not sorrow or complain
Lie still on the day of pain 
And the day of joy will greet yo.

Hearts live in the coming day
There's an end to passing sorrow 
Suddenly all files away 
And delight returns tomorrow
